-- capture.lua
-- Effect capture system using PCSX-Redux breakpoints
--
-- CRITICAL INSIGHT (2024-12): We capture at the START of caseD_2 (0x801a1920)
-- which is BEFORE texture upload AND before globals are set. This means:
-- 1. The effect file IS loaded in memory (lookup table has base address)
-- 2. NO globals have been initialized from the header yet
-- 3. TEXTURE HAS NOT BEEN UPLOADED TO VRAM YET
--
-- This is critical for live texture editing! When we:
-- 1. Capture at state 2 start
-- 2. Later reload with patched texture in RAM
-- 3. State 2 re-executes → FUN_801a0e80 uploads patched texture from RAM to VRAM!
--
-- State machine flow in effect_system_main_loop (0x801a18d8):
--   State 2 (0x801a1920): Texture upload via FUN_801a0e80
--   State 3 (0x801a1964): Initialize globals from header
--   State 4 (0x801a1ab0): Main effect execution loop
--
-- Previously we captured at caseD_3 (0x801a1964) which was AFTER texture upload,
-- making RAM texture patches useless since VRAM already had the old texture.
